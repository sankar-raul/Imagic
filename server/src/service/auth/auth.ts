/**
 * Authentication Service Layer
 *
 * Note: Authentication controller functions have been moved to:
 * src/api/controllers/auth.controller.ts
 *
 * This file can be used for additional authentication business logic
 * that doesn't directly handle HTTP requests/responses.
 *
 * For example:
 * - Database queries for user authentication
 * - Password hashing and verification
 * - Third-party authentication (OAuth, SAML, etc.)
 * - Custom authentication logic
 */

// You can add authentication service functions here
// Example:
// export const authenticateUser = async (email: string, password: string) => {
//   // Database query and password verification logic
// };
